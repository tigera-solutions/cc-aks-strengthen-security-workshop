# AKS and Calico blueprints hands-on workshop: <br> Strengthen security posture of app & K8s cluster

## Welcome

In this AKS-centric workshop, participants will work closely with Calico Cloud, a comprehensive networking and security solution provided by Tigera.  Throughout the workshop, we will explore a range of security features and best practices tailored for AKS deployments, learning to implement robust network security measures, enforce access controls, and fortify AKS environments against potential threats.

The purpose of this repository is to offer you a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on registering your AKS cluster on Calico Cloud, and securing your cloud-native applications to meet compliance requirements. Although Calico Cloud provides a wide range of functionalities and security features, this workshop will concentrate on a few key features used to protect your workload in runtime and deployment time. If you would like to delve deeper into this topic, please don't hesitate to contact us.
